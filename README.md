Description:

I am hoping to make a robot bearded dragon(Lizard) based on my own one whose name is Ralf! I plan to make him walk as realistically as I possibly can using its own power! I would like to make use of the RigidBodies, joints and motors to achieve this and also by creating a realistic texture hopefully I can make him look like one aswell.
